# Conway

Straight-forward approach to a flat, rectangular grid for Conway's Game of Life.

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives in the next generation
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell in the next generation
3. Any other live cell dies in the next generation
4. Any other dead cell remains dead in the next generation
